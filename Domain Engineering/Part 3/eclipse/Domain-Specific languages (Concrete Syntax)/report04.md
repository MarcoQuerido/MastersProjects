#### Questions

- Q1
  * How does the concrete syntax offered by Eugenia compares to that of your tool?
Classify both, justifying. Use the same classification categories as presented in lecture 4.

The syntax offered by Eugenia is the same as the one used in Sirius, as it is possible to use the same syntax in both IDE's. 
Eugenia could be described as a Horizontal DSL, as it has many uses in different contexts;
Eugenia could be described as an Imperative DSL, as we can define the steps and flow of the metamodel;
Eugenia could be described as a Graphical DSL, as we can create a metamodel using visual and graphical elements;
Eugenia could be described as an External DSL, as it has it's own specific syntax, which we could use by going to the Eugenia website: https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eugenia/;
