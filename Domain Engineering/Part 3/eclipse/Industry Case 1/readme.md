# EDOM Project, Part 3 Industry Cases (Spring Roo)

Spring Roo is a tool for fast and easy development of Java applications. The main objective of this tool is to generate part of the source code of an application with just a few configurations and some initial commands made in command lines. Spring Roo generates code with some of the main Java platform frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, JSF and GWT. All projects created by Spring Roo use Maven. The framework supports several tools for creating projects such as MVC with JSF, Spring or GWT frameworks, data persistence with Hibernate, EclipseLink and OpenJPA frameworks, creation of REST services, among others. Unlike other code generation tools, Spring Roo's goal is for the generated code to be extensible and easy to understand so that a programmer can continue the project with or without the help of Spring Roo. The tool provides commands so that, after code generation, it is possible to open the source code in the Eclipse IDE. In addition, the tool also generates automated unit and functional tests with the JUnit and Selenium frameworks.

• Model-Driven Engineering

– Principles
* For instance, how they address "models+transformations=software"?

The commands used to generate code apply to the creation of the application.

– Use Cases
* For instance, it is a forward engineering case or a reverse engineering case?

This industry case is a reverse engineering case i believe, as information is being collected from the given application and being developed.


– Integrating MDSE in the Development Process

* e.g., How does the case relates do Agile approaches?

Spring Roo is a Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool that aims to deliver fast, and instant results focused on Spring web applications and newer Spring technologies. It allows us to generate boilerplate code and project structure for Spring applications with simple to use commands. In general, the RAD approach prioritizes development and building a prototype, rather than planning.  With rapid application development, developers can quickly make multiple iterations and updates to the software without starting from scratch. This helps ensure that the final outcome is more quality-focused and aligns with the end users’ requirements.


– Domain-Specific Languages
* e.g., Are there DSLs in the case? How can we characterize the DSLs?

The Spring Integration Java configuration and DSL provides a set of convenient builders and a fluent API that lets the user configure Spring Integration message flows from Spring @Configuration classes.

– Tools used
* e.g., What MDE tools are used in the case? How they relate to the ones in the EDOM course?

The speakers use the Spring Tool Suite to demonstrate de application.
