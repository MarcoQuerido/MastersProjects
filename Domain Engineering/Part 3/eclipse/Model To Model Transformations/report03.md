#### Questions

- Q1
  * How does the model transformation support of your tool compares to ATL?

Sirius doesn't come with the ATL toolkit by default, but it can be downloaded from either the 'Eclipse Marketplace' or the 'Install New Software' buttons. It brings all the base functionalities of the ATL toolkit existent for Eclipse and works the same way. 

- Q2
  * The tool supports a language similar to ATL (a DSL for model transformations)? Or
transformations are specified in code (in a GPL)?

Sirius supports ATL for model transformations.

- Q3
  * Are transformations rules in the transformation language declarative (as ATL) or
imperative?

The transformation rules in Sirius are declarative.
