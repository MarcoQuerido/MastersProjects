## Working methodology ##

Our team follows an agile approach to meet the project’s objectives, specifically adopting the Scrum framework. We use Bitbucket for version control and Jira for managing epics and user stories.

In the Scrum framework, the roles of Scrum Master, Product Owner and Development Team (Dev and QA) are clearly defined, ensuring that everyone understands their responsibilities. With Jira, we create and track epics and user stories, giving the team a clear overview of tasks and project goals.

The combination of Scrum, Bitbucket, and Jira is ideal for our development setup. Scrum helps us manage evolving requirements through iterative deliveries and close client collaboration. Bitbucket facilitates efficient code management through strong version control, while Jira serves as a flexible tool for defining, tracking, and managing tasks to meet our project requirements.

We work in short sprints, which allow us to reassess and adjust priorities at the end of each iteration. If new client requirements or insights arise, we can easily modify or add user stories, ensuring our process remains adaptable.

An essential part of our methodology is ongoing evaluation. After every sprint, we hold retrospectives to pinpoint areas for improvement. Based on these reviews, we refine our process to enhance both our efficiency and the quality of our work over time.
